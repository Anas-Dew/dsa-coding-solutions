# Contributing Rules

1. File names should be edited on `this_style_formart` (lowercase letter saparated by underscores)
2. append your github username in the last of filename for example `fizz_buzz_yourgithubusername.file_extension`
3. Test cases should be present in the code (atleast one).
4. While contributing make sure solution isn't already in repo.

That will be good to explain the code writing comments.
